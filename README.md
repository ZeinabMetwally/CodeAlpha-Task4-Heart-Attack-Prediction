 Disease Prediction from Medical Data(Heart attack disease)

 In this project, I developed a model to predict the likelihood of a disease based on medical data, including symptoms and patient history. The goal was to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases more accurately and efficiently.
I explored several classification algorithms to build the predictive model. These algorithms included logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).
After training each model on labeled medical records, I evaluated their performance using various metrics. Among all the algorithms tested, the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting disease likelihood.
Based on the results, the KNN algorithm emerged as the most suitable choice for disease prediction in this context. Its high accuracy suggests its potential for practical implementation in healthcare settings, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
